# Classical-DFT

## Non-interacting fluid with finite size cores

Classical density functional model for fluid of hard cores or gaussian cores without interaction. The program finds the numerical solution to the functional i.e. the radial density. It is based on the paper:

[Introduction to Classical Density Functional Theory by a Computational Experiment](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ed500049m)

The minimization is implemented in the program: cDFT.cpp
